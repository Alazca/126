I had role B - linked lists intially.

### Task 1 ### 
The O(1) solution for my linked list would be to gather the first element in
a list. Due to how linked lists operate, it is nearly always based on the size of the list.

// T getFirst();

## Task 2 ###
A function that doubles in size of operations would be to get the first and last element. This would
be useful in a sorted array and we can determine what the range of values an operator would be working
in.

// T getRangeOfValues();


## Task 3 ###
An array operation that is proportional to the size of the list is print(). A loop would loop through
each element of an array and display the contents to the user, element by element. A larger sized
array, a longer output statement.

// void print();


## Task 4 ###
An array operation that would do half the operations would be grab the median or mode of the set of values.
The array size would be known and we can display either the top half or the lower half.

// void printBelow();
// void printAbove();


## Task 5 ###
O(n) functions depend the size of the data structure. As n approaches infinity, the amount of operations
increase linearly.
